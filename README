The Lua file type plug-in for Vim makes it easier to work with Lua source code in Vim by providing the following features:

  The 'includeexpr' option is set so that the gf (go to file) mapping knows how to resolve Lua module names using package.path
  The 'include' option is set so that Vim follows dofile(), loadfile() and require() calls when looking for identifiers in included files (this works together with the 'includeexpr' option)
  An automatic command is installed that runs "luac -p" when you save your Lua scripts. If luac reports any errors they are shown in the quick-fix list and Vim jumps to the line of the first error. If "luac -p" doesnt report any errors a check for undefined global variables is performed by parsing the output of "luac -p -l"
  <F1> on a Lua function or 'method' call will try to open the relevant documentation in the Lua Reference for Vim
  The 'completefunc' option is set to allow completion of Lua 5.1 keywords, global variables and library members using Control-X Control-U
  Several text-objects are defined so you can jump between blocks and functions
  A pretty nifty hack of the matchit plug-in is included: When the cursor is on a function or return keyword the % mapping cycles between the relevant keywords (function, return, end), this also works for branching statements (if, elseif, else, end) and looping statements (for, while, repeat, until, end)
